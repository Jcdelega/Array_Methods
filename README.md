# 🛍️ Array Methods Project in JavaScript

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to apply some of the most commonly used array methods in JavaScript to manipulate data efficiently and dynamically. This **SPA (Single Page Application)** simulates product filtering, searching, and sorting in an online store.

---

## 🎯 Project Description

You are given an array of products with attributes such as name, price, category, and rating. Through the interface, the user can:

- **Filter** products by price using `filter()`
- **Search** products by name using `includes()`
- **Sort** products alphabetically using `sort()`
- **Display** only product names using `map()`
- **Evaluate** array conditions using `some()` and `every()`

---

## 🧠 Array Methods Used

- `filter()` – to display products with a price lower than a given number
- `sort()` – to sort products alphabetically by name
- `map()` – to create a new array containing only the product names
- `includes()` – to search for product names containing a specific string
- `some()` – to check if there is at least one product rated above 4.5
- `every()` – to verify if all products belong to the same category (e.g., "Clothing")
